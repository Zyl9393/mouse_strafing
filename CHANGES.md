# 2.0 (2020-12-22)
* Pressing C to adjust pivot distance now ignores backfaces when backface culling is enabled in viewport settings.
* Added camera roll mouse action. Can press R to reset roll.
* Mouse strafing now remains active while at least one mouse button is still pressed, regardless of whether strafing key was released.
* Addon now cooperates with "Lock camera to view" and "Local camera" settings.
* Improved ergonomics of mouse acceleration.
* `package.bat` now creates Linux-compatible archives.
* Ctrl and Alt now affect strafe speed and pan sensitivity, respectively. Hold both to greatly reduce strafe speed.
* Quad views are now somewhat supported. Blender seems to have a slew of its own bugs with them.
